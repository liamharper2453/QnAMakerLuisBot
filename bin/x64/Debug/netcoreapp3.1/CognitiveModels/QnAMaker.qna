There are numerous events on CAPE and several of these may result in updates to Fund Master Data e.g. benchmark changes, registering funds in new countries etc.

If a data change is required as a result of a CAPE event, a task will be generated to the data owners to update the relevant fields in Fund Master.

**Description**

Tripartite is an ASI process in which a governing body of three teams (Fund Management, Fund Governance / Client Management and Investment Governance) oversee the running of a fund. A fund which is subject to tripartite must seek approval or attestation from representatives of the three teams before making certain changes to fund data that materially impact the fund.

If a field is subject to tripartite approval, a Tripartite CAPE event must be raised prior to change being made. Once approved the data owners can then proceed to make the changes in the relevant systems.

Once a share class / series has become live, data will inevitably change during its lifespan.

All data will be maintained directly in the Fund Master User Interface by data owners / stewards.

Some data changes will be initiated by a CAPE event or task, while other data may be updated due to projects or smaller BAU updates.

Finally some data in Fund Master is considered tripartite controlled. This means these data points should only change subject to an approval from Tripartite.

A CAPE event should be raised prior to this data being changed in the UI.
